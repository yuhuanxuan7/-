Paste all of your answers into a single answer document. See below for details of acceptable formats. 



a)

Write a shell script which adds up 10 numbers entered by the user and displays

the result to the screen. You must use the “read” command to obtain the numbers 

from the user. (4 marks)  

b)

Alter the script you wrote in part a) of this question so that it works for an arbitrary list of numbers. Again, you must use the “read” command to obtain all input from the user. (5 marks)

Write a script which takes in a number from the user and prints out the corresponding day of the week, e.g. Monday for 1 and Sunday for 7. Try, if you can, to make sure the program doesn’t crash if the user enters something unexpected. (5 marks)  

d)

Write a script which makes a new directory called “MyScriptFiles”, copies all shell scripts (i.e. those ending in “.sh” – you can ignore any permutations such as “.SH”) from the current directory to the new directory,  produces a list of files within that directory redirected to a new file called  “DirectoryListing.txt” and displays on the screen the number of lines in the file, “DirectoryListing.txt”.  (5 marks)  

e) 

Write a shell script which looks at the contents of the current directory and for all directories prints out the word “Directory” followed by the name of the directory and a comma-separated list of the directory’s contents sorted by modification time and for all files prints out the word “File” and the name of the file.
